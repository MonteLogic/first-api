A WooCommerce Blocks Extension

## Development

To get started, run the following commands:

```text
npm install
npm start
```

From [wp-scripts](https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/tree/master/packages/scripts) for more usage information.

toDo:

- I have to create a Control Panel component on the edit side with toggle switches.
  - I may be able to use Attributes to double show data, show it can change
    in real time rather than based on a http request.
